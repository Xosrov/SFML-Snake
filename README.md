# SFML-Snake
Simple snake game written in SFML, a little project for me to test myself with bigger projects.
Compiling the source files requires you to install the SFML library and link it to the compiler with these parameters:
-lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system


Code Documentation is still lacking, this project is still not fully complete!
Some things i haven't done:
1. General cleaning of code
2. Adding a Screen to display win/lose message, as well as ability to replay(should be easily done by editing main)
3. Check if there are any memory leaks(this is my first project after all)
4. Get settings from seperate file(Currently they are either defined or given to functions by hand)
